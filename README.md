# Personal-Blog-Assignment
This is the repository for my personal blog assignment.

## What I did to accomplish goals in this project
I built two separate HTML files, 2 separate CSS files and 2 separate JavaScript files to ultimately connect the two pages using JavaScript functions. I used CSS to style both pages, JS to make them more functional. On the first page there is a simple blog submission form featuring a place for your name, a title and the content of your blog. If any of the three input fields are left empty, you will be prompted to fill them out before continuing. Once all fields are filled out, upon clicking submit your input data is logged into local storage and you are taken to the blog page where your input data is pulled from local storage and displayed on the page. There is a functional dark/light mode toggle which uses an emoji of a moon for dark mode and a sun for light mode. On click the toggle switches the entire page to or from dark mode to or from light mode. Some of the styles change depending on the mode you select. There is also a "go back" button in the top right which takes you back to the blog submission form page. Finally, the footer has a link to my personal portfolio.

## How I accomplished my goals with this project
I used JSON to stringify the user input data, get and set items within local storage in order to pull the data onto the page. Multiple functions were used in both JavaScript files to get all of the moving parts working correctly.

## Usage
This pair of webpages are to be used to create and keep track of blog posts. To use the page simply input your information, name, title for your post, and your content of your blog post. You will then be taken to the post portion where all of your posts will be displayed in order. There is also a go back button in the top right where if clicked will take you back to the input landing page. Dark/light mode toggle in the for of an emoji right next to the header where if clicked will switch you to the appropriate mode matching the emoji. Finally on the bottom of the blog page there is a link to my personal portfolio!
